								<h3>Devin Winkler</h3>
							</header>
							<p class="bio-spotlights">Hello! My name is Devin and I am the owner of Babies and Bellies
								3D Ultrasound. I took over Babies and Bellies, originally founded by my Mom, when I had
								my first baby and realized I needed
								to make a career change that would allow me to be with him for all the important moments
								and milestones. For me, becoming a mother was a completely transformative process that
								left me in complete awe of mothers and women in general. I am now expecting my second
								baby boy and continue to be totally in tune with the needs and wants of expectant
								mothers.</br></br>

								I love to offer a service that allows mothers-to-be an experience that connects them to
								their baby before they are able to meet. For some, our services offer relief from worry.
								For others, it can be a celebration with friends and family. We hope you have a positive
								experience from start to finish when working with Babies and Bellies!

								<h3>Deanna Parsons</h3>
							</header>
							<p class="bio-spotlights">Deanna is our lead ultrasound technician and has been with us
								since 2011. She first
								became interested in the ultrasound field while attending her own ultrasounds for her
								children and while pregnant with her 2nd child she decided to take the leap and follow
								her dreams. She graduated from a diagnostic medical ultrasound program in New York, NY
								in 2008.</br></br>

								Her first job after graduation was at a 3D ultrasound facility in NY where she developed
								her passion for obstetric ultrasound. She relocated to Rhode Island in 2010 and was
								determined to find a job doing what she loves most and fate brought her to Babies and
								Bellies!</p>

								<h3>Michelle Galipeau</h3>
							</header>
							<p class="bio-spotlights">Michelle attended CCRI in Lincoln, RI. She graduated in 1986
								receiving an associate’s
								degree in Radiology. She was hired at a local community hospital as an x-ray technician
								working in diagnostic imaging. The ultrasound department was nearby and it wasn’t long
								before she sparked an interest in sonography.</br></br>

								She soon found herself back at school for ultrasound at the urging of a fellow
								colleague. Throughout her schooling, she remained employed by the same community
								hospital changing from a position in x-ray to a position in ultrasound in
								1993.</br></br>

								She became registered by the ARDMS in abdominal and OBGYN ultrasound in 1994. She has
								always found scanning obstetrics one of the most rewarding areas to work in. It’s what
								originally sparked her interest in the ultrasound field. She started her position at
								Babies and Bellies in 2021 and is thrilled to be working with an exceptional team doing
								what she loves.</p>
